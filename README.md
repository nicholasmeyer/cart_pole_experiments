# Cart pole experiments
## Introduction 

This implementation has been adapted from the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nano degree. The aim is to experiment with policy based methods, namely: hill climbing and steepest ascent as was discussed in the lectures. Furthermore, the implementation allows the user to choose either adaptive noise scaling or simulated annealing as a method to adjust the standard deviation of the  Gaussian noise used in the optimization of the policy parameters
